A simple Rock Paper Scissors game to practice basic JavaScript fundamentals.

What I learned:
- how to create functions in javascript
- modifying strings and using ES6 template literals (\`${expression}\`)
- how to write switch statements and for/while loops
- interact with users through browser-specific functions (e.g. alert, prompt)
- difference between abstract equality operator (==) and strict equality operator (===)
